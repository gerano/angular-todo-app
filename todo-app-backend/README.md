# MyTodoApp Backend

The backend is following the MEAN stack approach

## Development server

Run `nodemon server` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/todo`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This is the approach I was developing with.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the API tests via [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).
